            <h2>volleyball</h2>
            <p>
                Volleyball wasn’t always my go-to sport. I used to hop between different activities like basketball, chess, and badminton. 
                I initially thought volleyball was more of a girls' game, but that changed when I pulled off a great spike. It felt so 
                satisfying that I kept asking for more tries, spiking again and again until the sun set. After that, I joined my high school 
                volleyball team and trained hard, leading me to where I am today.

        <!--    Second Hobby div (Coding)    -->
        <div id="hobbyTwo">
            <img src="Images/coding.png" class="pictures" alt="">
            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>
                Coding is one of my hobbies because when I get tired of playing volleyball or mobile games, I dive into learning more advanced
                coding techniques. I’m confident in my skills with Java, Python, and C#. I find coding enjoyable, even when faced with challenges. 
                I often laugh at small mistakes like missing a semicolon or forgetting to increment an index in a loop, which sometimes even causes 
                my laptop to crash. Despite the challenges, I genuinely enjoy coding!

        <!--    Third Hobby div (Music)    -->
        <div id="hobbyThree">
            <img src="Images/music.jpg" class="pictures" alt="">
            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>
                Music is like a companion for me, especially when I’m by myself. I also listen to it while coding or playing mobile games. The type 
                of music I choose depends on my mood—if I’m feeling excited or upbeat, I go for groovy tunes. When I want to relax, I turn to country 
                or calming music. As I said, it all depends on how I’m feeling.
            </p>

        <!--    Fourth Hobby div (Anime)    -->
        <div id="hobbyFour">
            <img src="Images/anime.jpg" class="pictures" alt="">
            <h2>Anime</h2>
            <p>
                I wasn’t really into anime at first until a friend suggested it. Initially, I was hesitant and didn’t really want to watch, but my friend 
                insisted and recommended "Black Clover." Since it was during the pandemic, I decided to give it a shot. I was biased during the first few 
                episodes, thinking it wasn’t that great, but eventually, I started enjoying it more and more. By the time I finished the series, I was hooked
                and asked my friend for more anime recommendations.
