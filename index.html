        <p id="aboutMe">
        Hello, my name is Sojo Sales A. Decaran, and I am 21 years old. Originally from Loacan, Itogon, Benguet, I am currently residing in Brookside, Baguio City. 
        I have always been passionate about activities that engage both my mind and body—whether it’s playing volleyball, coding, listening to music, watching anime, 
        or diving into mobile games.

        <br><br>

        My academic journey began at Loacan Elementary School, followed by my completion of junior and senior high school at Loacan National High School, where I earned
        a TVL - automotive strand NC1 certificate. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, specializing in Web Technologies, at the 
        University of the Cordilleras.

        <br><br>

        I chose Information Technology because it offers a wide range of specializations—whether in web development, network security, or computer science—each presenting a 
        future filled with opportunities. What draws me the most to IT is its focus on problem-solving, from debugging code to planning intuitive user interfaces. These challenges 
        align with my personal learning style, where I thrive on solving complex problems and developing creative solutions.

        <br><br>

        Moreover, IT is a field that's continuously evolving, and its demand is increasing rapidly as businesses and industries shift towards digital platforms. I see this trend as 
        a gateway to a promising career where I can contribute to meaningful technological advancements. While there are many reasons behind my choice of this path, I’m confident 
        that IT will allow me to merge my passion for technology with my desire for continuous learning and growth.
